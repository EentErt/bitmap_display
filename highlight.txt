Set the highlight level for the image.

Syntax: Highlight #(0-255)

When an image is compressed for display, four adjacent pixels are combined
into a single pixel whose value is the average of the original pixels.
If one pixel has a value of [highlight level] or greater, the resulting pixel is
assigned that pixel's value instead. This may result in a greater detail
retention. For very small values, may introduce some noise in the resulting image.
